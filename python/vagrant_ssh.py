"""
Script to run a command via ssh inside vagrant.

What it does: we're inside a directory that we know has been mounted in a
local vagrant box. We ``cd`` to the corresponding directory and run the
command there.


- Virtual machines are inside ``~/vm/VM_NAME/``.

- That ``~/vm/VM_NAME/`` directory is mounted as ``/vagrant/`` inside the VM.

- The vm name is "django" for a vm inside ~/vm/django/`` and it has a
corresponding alias inside your ssh config file. So ssh'ing to "django"
means you connect just fine to the right VM with the vagrant user. An
example of such a config that ought to go inside ``~/.ssh/config`` ::

## Host django
## HostName 33.33.33.20
## User vagrant

## Oh, and make sure you use ``ssh-copy-id`` to copy your ssh key to the
## vagrant box, otherwise you'll go mad typing your password all the time.
